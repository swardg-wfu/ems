PHP-based project to interact with Accruent EMS's authenticated REST API. EMS is their room scheduling management software.

-- 10/7/2024
-- A lot of this will not be functional. it's more for posterity. 
-- reason being that I can't connect to EMS's API; I'm not authenticated.
-- I've been able to do development because Postman is authenticated,
-- so I can generate code to query the API with, pass that to Postman,
-- then copy the response from Postman into the script whose purpose is
-- ingesting the API response.
